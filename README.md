### Signature
The merchantâ€™s backend and DeePay create the same signature based on the same secret key and algorithm and use it to verify each other's identity.

#### General steps to create a signature:
1. Presume all data sent and received is the set M. Sort non-empty values in M in ascending alphabetical order (i.e. lexicographical sequence), and join them into string A via the corresponding URL key-value format (e.g. key1=value1&key2=value2...).
Notes:
    * Sort parameter names in ascending alphabetical order based on their ASCII encoded names (e.g. lexicographical sequence);
    * Empty parameter values are excluded in the signature;
    * Parameter names are case-sensitive;
    * When checking returned data or a DeePay push notification signature, the transferred sign parameter is excluded in this signature as it is compared with the created signature.

2.  Add "key= (API key value) to the end of stringA to get stringSignTemp, perform MD5 arithmetic on stringSignTemp, convert all result chars to upper case, thus get sign's value (signValue).
